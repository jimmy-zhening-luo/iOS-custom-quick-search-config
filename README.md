iOS lacks the fully-customizable quick search provided by Google Chrome desktop.

I wrote an iOS shortcut mimicking Chrome quick search. For example, I can set a config so that if I search for “w strawberry shortcake”, the shortcut will understand that query as https://en.m.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?search=strawberry+shortcake.

This repo contains configs for various iOS shortcuts I’ve written, including this quick search feature.
